<!-- HTML structure: The code creates a basic HTML structure for a Book Management System interface. 
    It consists of various HTML elements, such as <input>, <textarea>, and <button> used to gather information about books, 
        including the book name, author name, book description, and the number of pages. The interface provides 
        labeled input fields and a button to add books to the system.

    User input handling: Each input field (book name, author name, description, and number of pages) is associated
     with an ID attribute, allowing JavaScript to retrieve their values. When the "Add Book" button is clicked, it 
     triggers the addBook() function (not included in the provided code) to collect the entered book details from the input fields.
    
    Book display section: The code includes a section <div id="books"> meant to display the added books. However, 
        it lacks the JavaScript functionality to populate and display the books. As it stands, this section is indicated as the
         area where the books will be displayed, but there's no JavaScript logic provided to showcase the added books in this section.
    
    To include js file in book_system.html, a script tag is used in HTML file above </body> tag. -->
